_A Decentralized Zero-Knowledge Cloud Computing Network_.

[Nexus Labs](https://nexus.xyz) is a scientific organization building the worldâ€™s first general-purpose [verifiable cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing) network, powered by [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof).

We believe in the power of zero-knowledge cryptography to bring the next-generation of highly scalable verifiable compute to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and the rollup ecosystem.

We obsess about enabling a beautiful developer experience. That is why Nexus is designed to allow developers to write their own _verifiable_ cloud programs in their favorite programming languages, starting with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
