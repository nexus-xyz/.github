_A Decentralized Cloud Computing Network_.

[Nexus Labs](https://nexus.xyz) is a scientific organization building the worldâ€™s first general-purpose [verifiable cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing) platform.

We believe in the power of cryptography to bring highly scalable verifiable compute to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and the rollup ecosystem.

Technology:

- [Nexus Zero](https://zero.nexus.xyz): *A general-purpose verifiable cloud computing network powered by zero-knowledge proofs.* Execution Layer: STARK-based zkVM + Rust SDK.

- [Nexus](https://litepaper.nexus.xyz): *A general-purpose verifiable cloud computing network powered by multi-party computation.* Execution Layer: WASM-based VM + Rust SDK.

We obsess about removing friction and a great developer experience. That is why Nexus is designed to allow developers to write their first _verifiable_ cloud programs in their favorite programming languages, starting with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
